TalkOut – React Task
Use the Marvel API to create a simple Marvel characters
catalog.
Requirements
We would like you to build a simple application that displays a paginated list of
Marvel characters.
Each item in the list should contain the character’s name and image.
When clicking on a character, the app should display character details.
The character detail view should display the name, image and description, as well as
a list of comics in which this character appears.
Additional Information
The main goal of this task is to fetch and display a list of items from an API. After
selecting an item, the app should navigate to a detail view with some more
information.
We should be able to run this app locally without any extra configuration - just install
dependencies and start.
Details on the Marvel API can be found here: https://developer.marvel.com
Feel free to use this task to demonstrate any React patterns and/or packages you
like.
Essentials
• The solution must use TypeScript and React
• Use of React hooks and functional components is preferred over class
components
• The character list must be paginated either using a list with pages or infinite
scroll.
Extra Points
• Writing some tests
• Styling (you can use anything you like here, e.g. Styled Components, CSS,
CSS framework)
• UX: Friendly error handling (for example alerts with errors)
• Accessibility (for example screen reader friendly implementation)
Your solution should be provided as a link to a Git repository, or you can zip and
send via email.
Good luck!
